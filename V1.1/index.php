				<p>Open learning community is one of the forms of Alternative education. Alternative education encompasses many pedagogical approaches differing from mainstream pedagogy. In modern times, at least in some localities, the legal right to provide educational alternatives has become established alongside a duty to provide education for school age children. In an open learning community, Learner -  responsible model is emphasized. The approach caters to the interests and learning style of an individual. Children and teachers work together to share knowledge and skills.</p>
